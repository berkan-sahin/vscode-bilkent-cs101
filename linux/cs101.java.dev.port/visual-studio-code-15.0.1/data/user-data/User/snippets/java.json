	// Place your snippets for java here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	
	// I am including these three snippets for now with the bundle.
	// If you would like to add your own, go ahead, take a look at the ones below and see if you can figure out how they work.
	// You can take a look here as well: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets
